I'm **zo9n**, a Web back end developer who is not bald, likes to code, loves the *One Piece* and a man who dreams of becoming the king of sea.

About this site, the main content is to record my own life which includes the experience of coding, the imagination in my head, and what I saw and heard. 



Besides, sometimes I may write something in bad English because I also want to improve my English by writing in English.
